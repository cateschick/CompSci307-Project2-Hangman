Name: Cate Schick

### Timeline

Start Date: September 2nd, 2021

Finish Date: September 6th, 2021

Hours Spent: 20 hours

### Tutorial and other Resources Used

I referenced the Refactoring reading to help me move methods in this project.

I referenced Oracle documentation on Circles and Rectangles
to help me construct my body parts

### Resource Attributions
https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/javafx/api/javafx/scene/shape/Rectangle.html

### Running the Program

Main class: Main.java

Data files needed: N/A

Key/Mouse inputs: 

The secretword is entered in the beginning of the game for INTERACTIVE secret keeper

The guesser inputs letters for INTERACTIVE guesser

Before running Main, you can select the type of guesser and type
of secret keeper that you wish to play with.

Known Bugs:
I lose with the Clever Guesser more often than I thought I would, making me 
wonder if there was a bug in my implementation of the Clever algorithm.

### Notes/Assumptions
This was a fun project. It was satisfying to build off of something
that I had written Python code to a few years ago in CS101.

### Impressions
Refactoring Java code is a lot more difficult than I thought it would be.
